## TODO
0) Use YouTube API to check if there is a patron
1) Filter the pictures: use the amount of blue to know if it is the sea or not
2) Check how can I get videos only from Australia
3) Make a doc file for each python file
4) Add specie and location of each video
5) Cut Joey Paesano videos 

## Check
- Use category id to avoid videos such as Shark Tank
- Find a way to avoid repeated videos: 
  you could use the upload day and length -> specially for news
